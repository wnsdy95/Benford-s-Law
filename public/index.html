    <meta name="description" content="Benford's law, or the Newcombâ€“Benford law,
    observes that in real-life numerical data, smaller digits often appear as
    the first digit. For example, the number 1 occurs as the first digit 30% of
    the time, whereas 9 appears only 5% of the time. If digits were uniformly
    distributed, each would occur 11.1% of the time. The law also applies to the
    distribution of second, third digits, digit combinations, and so on. The
    deviation formula, represented as, ((DD - ID) / ID) x 100, where DD: Data
    Distribution ID: Ideal Distribution is a mathematical expression used to
    quantify the difference between the actual data distribution (DD) and the
    ideal or expected distribution (ID). This formula calculates the percentage
    deviation of the observed data distribution from the ideal distribution. In
    this context, DD stands for Data Distribution, which refers to the
    observed distribution of data in a given dataset. ID, on the other hand,
    represents the Ideal Distribution, which is the theoretical or expected
    distribution of data based on Benford's Law. The resultant value from this
    formula indicates the extent of deviation of the actual data from the
    expected norm. A significant deviation, particularly when it exceeds 20%,
    especially in the higher value digits like 8 or 9, is often considered
    indicative of artificial or manipulated data. This is because natural
    datasets typically adhere to certain statistical properties or laws, such as
    Benford's Law. In the context of lotteries, this formula and its
    implications is not particularly relevant. Lottery numbers are often
    expected to conform to specific statistical patterns. However, unlike
    traditional applications of Benford's Law, which is generally applicable to
    naturally occurring datasets, lottery numbers are more akin to identifiers
    rather than naturally occurring mathematical figures. Therefore, the
    distribution of lottery numbers might not necessarily align with the
    patterns predicted by Benford's Law, which primarily applies to datasets
    where numbers are representative of naturally occurring quantities or
    sizes." />
